# Descriptive Statistics Analysis on Household Data
# Overview
This project provides an in-depth descriptive statistical analysis of household income and expenses. The dataset contains key variables like monthly household income, monthly household expenses, the number of family members, EMI or rent amounts, and the highest educational qualification of a family member. The goal is to understand the distribution, variability, and relationships between these variables using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

# Dataset Features
The dataset includes:

Mthly_HH_Income: Monthly household income.
Mthly_HH_Expense: Monthly household expenses.
No_of_Fly_Members: Number of family members.
Emi_or_Rent_Amt: Amount paid for EMI or rent.
Annual_HH_Income: Annual household income.
Highest_Qualified_Member: Highest education qualification of a family member.
No_of_Earning_Members: Number of earning members in the household.

# Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development.
Analysis Approach
Data Loading: Loading the household dataset using Pandas.

# Descriptive Statistics:
Mean, Median, and Mode: Calculating key measures of central tendency for income and expense variables.
Standard Deviation and Variance: Understanding the spread and dispersion of the data.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Analyzing variability through quartile-based measures.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing income vs. expenses using scatter plots.
Distribution of the highest qualification of family members through bar plots.
Income and expenses distribution by family size, rent, and EMI.

# Insights:
Households with different education levels and their corresponding income patterns.
Family size impact on household income and expense management.
Relationship between rent/EMI payments and overall household budget.
Code Implementation

# Key findings from the analysis:

The average monthly household income is approximately ₹41,558, with significant variability as the income ranges from ₹5,000 to ₹100,000.
The most common household income value (mode) is ₹45,000.
Households with higher numbers of earning members tend to have greater total household incomes and lower financial burdens.
The distribution of household expenses indicates that most households spend between ₹10,000 and ₹25,000 monthly.
Future Work
Real-Time Data Integration: Enhance the dataset with real-time economic data to make predictions about household financial health.
Additional Features: Include more demographic variables like occupation, age, and location for more granular insights.
